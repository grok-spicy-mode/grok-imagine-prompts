Combine multiple artistic references for sophisticated results:

```
Classical renaissance portrait style +
modern fashion photography +
rembrandt lighting +
editorial composition
```

### Negative Prompting

While Grok Imagine doesn't explicitly support negative prompts, you can specify what you want to avoid by emphasizing positive alternatives:

```
Instead of: "no nudity"
Use: "elegant fully clothed fashion, sophisticated styling"
```

### Resolution Optimization

- **Portraits**: 1024x1024 for best facial detail
- **Fashion Editorial**: 1024x1024 or 1920x1080 for full-body shots
- **Artistic Composition**: Match to intended use (print, web, etc.)

### Style Mixing

Combine era and style references:

```
Victorian era fashion meets modern editorial photography,
classical painting technique meets contemporary subject matter,
art deco aesthetic with modern fashion sensibility
```

## Troubleshooting

### Image Rejected Despite Spicy Mode

**Problem**: Image still filtered even with Spicy Mode enabled

**Solutions**:
- Add more artistic context and professional terminology
- Reference established art traditions
- Emphasize creative and editorial purpose
- Use fashion/art industry language

### Results Too Conservative

**Problem**: Output doesn't match creative intent

**Solutions**:
- Be more specific about artistic style desired
- Reference specific fashion photographers or artists
- Add editorial context (magazine names, style references)
- Emphasize "artistic expression" and "creative work"

### Inconsistent Results

**Problem**: Same prompt gives different restriction levels

**Solutions**:
- Add more context and specificity
- Include professional terminology consistently
- Reference established artistic works
- Frame within clear artistic tradition
